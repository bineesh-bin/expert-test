Lead Capture Form
---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Saving Leads to Supabase Database

**File**: [src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)  

**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Lead data was not being saved persistently in the Supabase database on form submission, risking data loss.

#### Root Cause

Lead data insertion code was missing or incomplete, causing leads not to be stored.

#### Fix

Added code to insert lead data into the `leads` table in Supabase, ensuring persistence.


#### Impact

  Leads are now saved reliably in the database.

  Improved data integrity and follow-up capability.

### 2.Removed Duplicate Confirmation Email Function Call

**File**: [src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)  

**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The confirmation email function was called twice, causing duplicate emails to be sent.

#### Root Cause

Duplicate invocation of the `send-confirmation` Supabase function.

#### Fix

Removed the duplicate call so the confirmation email function is invoked only once after saving the lead.


#### Impact

  No more duplicate confirmation emails.

  Better user experience and reduced email spam.
